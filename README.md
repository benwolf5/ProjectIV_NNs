# ProjectIV_NNs
Collection of all the coding files used to create figures and obtain results for Project IV, titled Applying Neural Networks to Classification Problems in Different Dimensions. 
For the degree of Mathematical Sciences MMath from the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Durham University.
Supervised by Dr Marija Zamaklar and Dr Kasper Peeters.


The folder plots shows all the Python, MATLAB and R files used to create the figures and plots used in my project.

facemask_detector_gcolab.ipynb is a Python notebook of a binary classification CNN to detect people wearing face masks or not. The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/manishkc06/face-mask-dataset

alexnet-cifar10.py is a Python file to train AlexNet on the CIFAR-10 benchmark dataset.

predicting-sine.ipynb is a Python Notebook of a NN which identifies the period and amplitude of a given sine function of form f(x)=Asin(\omega x)
